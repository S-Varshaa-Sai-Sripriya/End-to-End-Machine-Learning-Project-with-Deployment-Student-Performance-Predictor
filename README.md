# 🎯 End-to-End Machine Learning Project with Deployment

A production-grade machine learning pipeline for predicting student math scores based on demographic and academic features. The entire workflow includes automated data ingestion, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment using Flask and Azure App Service.
---

## ✨ Key Features

- 🔁 **Automated Pipeline**: Data ingestion → transformation → model training → deployment
- 🧠 **Hyperparameter Tuning**: GridSearchCV across 7+ models (XGBoost, CatBoost, Random Forest, etc.)
- 🚨 **Robust Exception Handling**: Custom logging with detailed error tracebacks
- 🔧 **CI/CD Integration**: GitHub Actions pipeline for automated Azure deployment
- 🧹 **Scalable Preprocessing**: `ColumnTransformer` to handle mixed feature types
